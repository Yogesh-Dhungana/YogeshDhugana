				<!-- about  welcome text -->
                <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Greetings! I am an ambitious and dedicated individual with a passion for education, leadership, and community engagement. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in public policy at New York University Abu Dhabi, I have consistently sought opportunities to learn, grow, and make a positive impact. Through a diverse array of roles, internships, and initiatives, I have honed my skills and contributed meaningfully to various projects.

                  My journey in education began at New York University Abu Dhabi in August 2020, where I embarked on a pursuit of knowledge in Economics with a minor in public policy. This academic endeavor has provided me with a strong foundation in economic principles and policy analysis, empowering me to approach complex challenges with a well-rounded perspective.
                  
                  Prior to my university studies, I completed my School Leaving Certificate (SLC) at Gandaki Boarding School in Pokhara, Nepal in May 2019. This early education laid the groundwork for my future pursuits, instilling in me a drive for academic excellence and a thirst for knowledge.</p>
